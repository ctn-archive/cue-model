\chapter{Association Matrix Learning}

The TCM requires two association matrices, $\mat M_\ped{TF}$ and $\mat M_\ped{FT}$, to be updated.
To translate this into neurons an appropriate learning rule has to be derived.
The TCM gives the update of such an association matrix as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mat M_{i+1} =& \mat M_i + \Delta \mat M_i \\
    \Delta \mat M_i =& \vc b_i \vc a_i\Tr
\end{eqnarray}
for adding an association from $\vc a$ to $\vc b$.
The association matrix after $n$ updates can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \mat M_n = M_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta \mat M_i = M_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \vc b_i \vc a_i\Tr \text{.}
\end{equation}
This allows us to express the neural connection weights after learning $n$ associations as
\begin{equation}
